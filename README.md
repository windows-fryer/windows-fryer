# 👋 Hello, World!

## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Liga** from the **United States**. 🇺🇸

## 💻 My Programming Journey

I've been on an incredible programming journey for almost **9 years** now. Over the years, I've dabbled in various aspects of software development, but recently, I've found my true passion in **low-level development**. 🛠️

### 🏆 Awards
- 🥉 Bronze medalist in SkillsUSA Oregon 2024
- 🇺🇸 Nationalist nominee for SkillsUSA 2024
- ✨ 4 on AP Computer Science A exam
- 📋 Top 10 team for George Fox programming competition of 2024


### 🏁 Early Days

My programming adventure began with high-level languages, where I explored the vast landscapes of web development, app creation, and even some game development. These experiences laid a solid foundation for my skills and ignited my curiosity to delve deeper into the world of coding. 🌐📱🎮

### 🔍 Recent Focus

In the past few years, I've shifted my focus towards **low-level development**. This area fascinates me because it allows me to work closer to the hardware, optimize performance, and understand the inner workings of computer systems. It's like peeling back the layers of an onion to reveal the core. 🧅🔧
